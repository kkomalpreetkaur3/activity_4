## Additional Information

Below are the 3 components that are implemented in this activity:

### Signals and Slots 
   - Connected button `clicked` signals to private slot methods (`__on_add_contact`, `__on_remove_contact`).

### Event Handling
   - Implemented event-driven responses where the program reacts to user actions such as adding, selecting, and removing contacts.

### QMessageBox for User Confirmation
   - Used a `QMessageBox.question()` dialog to confirm contact removal before processing the event.
